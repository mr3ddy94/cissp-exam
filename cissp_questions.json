For SQL injection: validate input format + use parameterized queries + enforce least-privilege DB account + WAF + error handling that doesn't reveal DB structure. If one layer fails, others compensate. A WAF alone can be bypassed; parameterized queries alone don't prevent other injection types. Multiple layers provide robust protection.",

      "Filing a SAR with FinCEN",
      "Notifying the relevant PCI DSS card brands and potentially state breach notification laws",
      "Reporting to the SEC within 4 days",
      "Notifying HHS within 60 days"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "PCI DSS requires immediate notification to the acquiring bank and card brands upon discovery of a breach. State breach notification laws (varying by state) also require notification to affected individuals, often within 30\u201372 hours. SEC 4-day rule applies to public companies for material cybersecurity incidents. HHS notification is for HIPAA breaches.",

      "To maximize storage utilization",

      "To make all data permanently available",
      "To prevent employees from accessing old data"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Data retention policies define how long different types of data must be kept (legal minimums) and when they must be destroyed. Keeping data longer than necessary increases storage costs, privacy risk, and legal discovery exposure. Destroying data too early can violate regulations. Proper retention balances compliance, cost, and risk.",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Incremental backups capture only data changed since the last backup (full or incremental), making each backup fast and small. However, restoration requires the last full backup plus every incremental since \u2014 the most tapes/files to process. Differential backups are slower to create but faster to restore (only need last full + last differential).",

      "Accept the risk since impact is low",
      "Apply cost-effective controls and monitor",
      "Transfer the risk to cyber insurance"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When likelihood is high but impact is low, the risk falls in a moderate priority zone. Cost-effective controls (like detective or administrative controls) combined with monitoring is the most balanced approach. Spending heavily would likely exceed the loss value. Pure acceptance ignores the high frequency. Insurance is better suited for high-impact risks.",

    "explanation": "Risk avoidance eliminates the risk by discontinuing the activity that causes it. This is the only strategy that can reduce a risk to zero \u2014 but it also means forgoing any associated benefit. It is appropriate when a risk is too high to mitigate cost-effectively.",
